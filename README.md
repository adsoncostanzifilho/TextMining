This interface was developed all in R using mainly the shiny and rtweet
packages. The tool is online on shinyapps' repository at the adress
<https://adsoncostanzi.shinyapps.io/TextMining/>.

PS: To run this app localy it is necessary to have Twitter autorization
(access\_token, access\_secret, api\_key, api\_secret). If you do not
have this autorization yet use the comand `rtweet::vignette("auth")`.
