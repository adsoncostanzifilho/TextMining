## Instructions

This interface was all developed in R using mainly the shiny and rtweet packages. The tool is online on shinyapps' repository at the adress <https://adsoncostanzi.shinyapps.io/TextMining/>.

PS: To run this app localy it is necessary to have Twitter autorization (access_token, access_secret, api_key, api_secret).
If you do not have this autorization yet use the comand `rtweet::vignette("auth")` and follow the instructions.

Once you have the Twitter API autorization you must create an R file called `twitter_credentias.R` inside the `app/credentials` folder. The file must have 5 objects: api_key, api_secret, access_token, access_secret, and app_name.

### Credential File Example 

The `twitter_credentias.R` file should follow the template below:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# set Twitter API parameters

api_key <- "XXX"
api_secret <- "XXX"
access_token <- "XXX"
access_secret <- "XXX"
app_name <- "xxxxx"
```
